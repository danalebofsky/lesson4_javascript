### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. This lesson taught me the importance of appropriately and neatly commenting your code so it is functional, readable and helpful to the programmer.
2. This lesson taught me that JavaScript is a loosely typed programming language, meaning that variables don't need to be declared as specific data types.
3. This lesson taught me the concept of 'variable scope' and how to properly declare variables in the scope intended.
